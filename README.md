# Text-Mining-And-Sentiment-Analysis
Using NLTK to build a text mining and Sentiment analysis algorithm for the analysis of tourists accomodation reviews of 30 restaurants  
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of text mining and sentiment analysis using Python. The project demonstrates how to extract, process, and analyze textual data to derive meaningful insights, with a particular focus on sentiment analysis.

# Features
- Text Preprocessing
  - Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
  - Handling of special characters, punctuation, and noisy data.
  
- Text Mining
  - Word frequency analysis and term-document matrix creation.
  - Keyword extraction and n-gram modeling.

- Sentiment Analysis
  - Classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
  - Leverages pre-trained sentiment models and custom implementations.

- Visualization
  - Word clouds, bar charts, and sentiment distribution plots.


# Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools and libraries are installed:
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, nltk, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and wordcloud.
- Jupyter Notebook or any compatible Python IDE.

# Installation Steps
Clone the Repository

# bash
    git clone https://github.com/BenedictIbe/Text-Mining-And-Sentiment-Analysis.git  
    cd Text-Mining-And-Sentiment-Analysis  

# Install Required Libraries
Use the following command to install dependencies:

# bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  

# Run the Project
Open the Jupyter Notebook files (Text_Mining.ipynb or Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb) and execute the cells step by step.

# Project Workflow
  - Data Loading
    - Input textual data from CSV, Excel, or plain text files.
    - Example dataset: customer reviews, social media posts, or news articles.

  - Text Preprocessing
    - Clean and prepare raw text for analysis by removing noise and standardizing formats.

  - Exploratory Text Mining
    - Perform frequency analysis to identify prominent words and phrases.
    - Generate word clouds for quick visual insights.

  - Sentiment Analysis
    - Apply pre-trained models such as VADER or TextBlob.
    - Train custom classifiers using machine learning techniques (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression).

  - Visualization
    - Display results with interactive plots and summaries.


# Usage Examples
  # Preprocessing Example

# python
    from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize  
    from nltk.corpus import stopwords  

    text = "This is an example sentence for preprocessing!"  
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())  
    cleaned_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.isalpha() and word not in stopwords.words('english')]  
    print(cleaned_tokens)  
    Sentiment Analysis Example
    Using VADER for sentiment scoring:

# python
    from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer  
    analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()  
    score = analyzer.polarity_scores("The product is amazing and exceeded expectations!")  
    print(score) 

# Results and Visualizations
- Word Clouds: Highlight frequently used words in the text.
- Sentiment Distribution: Show the proportion of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluate sentiment classifiers with precision, recall, and F1 scores.
